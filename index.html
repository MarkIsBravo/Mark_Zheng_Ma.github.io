      I completed my bachelor's degree in Beijing Langauge and Culture
      University, majoring in Chinese Language and Literature. It was
      an unforgettable experience and I developed my interest of being
      a Mandarin teacher during that time.

      Coming to the US was one of the best decisions in my life. I
      completed my Masters degree of Teaching and Curriculum at Syracuse
      University and it was an amazing two years. During that time, I
      explored a lot of resources on how technologies were used in
      education and experienced how much revolutionary they were to
      traditional ways of learning.

      After graduating from Syracuse University, I came to NYC and
      became a Mandarin teacher at a private school in Manhattan. It was
      a precious learning experience but not fulfilling enough for me.
      The more I experienced, the more I realize that I want to design my
      own educational technology and implement it in the classrooms.

      I have passions in being an educator since guiding others to come
      through difficulties is a satisfying process for me. I like the
      beauty of Chinese culture and, since Mandarin is becoming more and
      more popular, I would love to introduce more about this culture to
      people who have the same passion in learning it.

      The WDI program have started for a week and I still feel good
      about the whole learning process. I learned introductory level
      skills of HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript and I now am able to create
      this elegant webpage with the skills so far. I believe I would
      obtain more and more skills in a few weeks and we will see what
      new features I could add to this webpage.
